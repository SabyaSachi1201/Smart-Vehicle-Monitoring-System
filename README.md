# Smart-Vehicle-Monitoring-System
The base MCU platform is an ESP32 MCU, which was used due to it's  inbuilt wifi connecting capabilities.
Various sensors were interfaced in this project, more specifically, sensors like DHT11(Temperature and Humidity Sensor), IR sensor, GPS , LDR sensors etc. 
The "vehicle" has the capability to detect darkness and turn on lights , if a person approaches the vehicle.
Various functionalies of the vehicle could be also controlled using voice commands using AMAZON ALEXA that we interfaced through IFTTT.
Overall it was a very fun project to work on .
You can find a detailed demonstration on the working of this project , in the link below :
